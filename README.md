# Logistic-Regression-Bank-Full-Dataset
This repository contains my logistic regression assignment for Data Science. I've implemented a logistic regression model in python to predict Target variable. The dataset used for training and testing the model is kaggle Bank-Full. Feel free to explore the code and the results in the Jupyter Notebook provided.
